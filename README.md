### serpro-new-tab

My personal "new tab" as a chrome extension

#### Motivation

I've been using [NewTab-Redirect](https://github.com/jimschubert/NewTab-Redirect) chrome extension to have a local html file open for new tabs in Brave Browser, but the extension seems a bit abandoned, and eventually stopped working altogether for local files.

Therefore I've converted my local new-tab.html file into an extension of its own, which I add to brave manually via "load unpacked" extension option in brave://extensions (developer mode needs to be enabled for this to work)
